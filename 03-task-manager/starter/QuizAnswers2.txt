1. The asyncWrapper function was created to handle errors thrown by the controllers without requiring a try/catch for every controller function.
2. This answer depends. If we have not written a function to create errors for us, then we would use:
    return next (new CustomAPIError(`No task with id: ${taskID}`, 404));
However, if we did create a function to do so, then we would use:
    return next(createCustomError(`No task with id: ${taskID}`, 404));
